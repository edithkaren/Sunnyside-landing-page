## üìù Overview

### The Challenge

- Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
- Your users should be able to:
  - View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
  - See hover states for all interactive elements on the page


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

The major lesson I learnt from this project was to consider both desktop and mobile views while planning to use flexbox and grid. Something that could work with grid in desktop view may not work in mobile view.

### Continued development

I want to continue learning and getting better at CSS Application. I'm more comfortable with simple CSS and vanilla JS. So I want to practice using frameworks like React, Material UI etc.
